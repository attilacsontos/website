MONARC is a method and a tool for analyzing risks coupled with a free tool,
making itpossible to follow all of the best practices in the field of
information security. MONARC adopts the basic criteria of confidentiality (as
this is vital when personal data is involved – protection from divulgation),
integrity and availability, all of which are particularly relevant in the health
care field. Impact criteria are directly related to the organization’s
reputational, operational, legal and financial risks.

MONARC is an iterative method that makes it possible to carry out regular
reviews which only take into account changes that have been made. This means
that considerable time is saved in achieving compliance. And since risk analysis
with regard to personal data is carried out, it is highly probable that your
organization’s information system is already partly covered by its analysis
methodology. MONARC simply makes it possible to extend it to your services and
job processes.
