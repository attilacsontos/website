MONARC is a method for analyzing risks coupled with a free
[tool](https://github.com/monarc-project), making it possible to follow all of
the best practices in the field of information security.
MONARC adopts the basic criteria of confidentiality.

MONARC makes it possible to carry out regular reviews which only take into
account changes that have been made. This means that considerable time is saved
in achieving compliance.

MONARC is developed by [CASES](https://www.cases.lu).
