MONARC is a method for analyzing risks coupled with a free
[tool](https://github.com/monarc-project), making it possible to follow all of
the best practices in the field of information security.
MONARC adopts the basic criteria of confidentiality (as
this is vital when personal data is involved â€“ protection from divulgation),
integrity and availability.

MONARC is an iterative method that makes it possible to carry out regular
reviews which only take into account changes that have been made. This means
that considerable time is saved in achieving compliance.
